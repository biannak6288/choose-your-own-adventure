My final salon project for this class circles itself around the various theoris of ehtics we have learned this semester. I decided to create a 'choose your own adventure' interactive activity/quiz to determine whether the user relates more to Mill's, Kant's, Aristotle's or the philosophy of care ethics. Basically it is all in the users hands to determine who they best represent. Moreover, it is supposed to be an interesting and rather pleasant experience for all, though educational at the same time. So, please enjoy and try it out!
